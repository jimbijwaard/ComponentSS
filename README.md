ComponentSS
===========

ComponentSS is a very lightweight CSS boilerplate to start the development of a new website or application. Inside is a collection of reusable (S)CSS components for quick development.

The ComponentSS can be categorized in three sections; base, components and utilities.

- Base: defines a baseline for development. Contains a css reset as well as basic typography styles.
- Components: Prototypical srtucturs which are often replicated on many pages. These components are open to extention to fit with your design.
- Utilities: A set of shared common reusable classes which can be applied on any number of objects.


ComponentsSS is based on the work of the following exeptional developers:
- SMACSS by Jonathan Snook
- OOCSS by Nicole Sullivan
- Normalize.css, SUIT and Idiomatic CSS by Nicolas Galagher
- CSSWizardry / Beautons by Harry Roberts
